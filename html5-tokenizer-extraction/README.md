# HTML5 Tokenizer Specification Extractor
Simple script to massage the [HTML5 tokenizer spec.](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tokenization.html).

The script extracts a state machine from the spec, and can output it in JSON or in a DOT format. 

## Using the script

Example on how to use this script with [dot](http://www.graphviz.org) to generate an SVG representation of the tokenizer.
```
$ python html5-generator.py --dot html-tokenizer.dot
$ dot -Tsvg -O html-tokenizer.dot
```

## Dependencies
Several libraries are required to run this script:
- lxml
- Requests
- Colorama
- python-graph-core
